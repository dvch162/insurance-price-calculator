Insurance Price Calculator - Full Stack Application

This repository hosts a full stack insurance calculator application designed to streamline the insurance pricing process. The application empowers sales agents to quickly input customer details, select coverage options, apply discounts, and calculate a precise insurance premium instantly. The application's frontend and backend work in harmony to provide real-time updates and pricing information.
üéØ Project Objective

The goal is to develop an intuitive, responsive application that allows users to:

    Input customer data via a main form.
    Select optional coverages and discounts.
    Calculate and display the insurance price, which updates dynamically based on selections.
    Adjust and apply a voucher or price-match option to modify the total price.

Example Use Case

When a customer visits an agent‚Äôs office, the agent inputs the customer‚Äôs details into a simple form. As data is submitted:

    Sidebar updates to display selected coverages.
    Header shows available discounts and the total calculated price.
    Price Details are displayed below the form, including a breakdown of discounts and coverages.

üõ† Implementation

This project is split into two main components: Frontend and Backend.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend

The frontend provides an interactive interface where agents can enter details, select coverages, and see immediate price calculations.
Main Form

The form includes:

    Fields: Name, Birthdate, City, Vehicle Power, Voucher, Price Match (required where specified)
    Price Details: Shows the basic price, applied discounts, coverages, and final total price

Header

Displays:

    Available Discounts: Selectable options to apply customer-specific discounts
    Total Price: Reflects the calculated insurance premium after adjustments

Sidebar

Shows:

    Available Coverages: Checkboxes for selecting additional coverages, with immediate application to the total price

Real-Time Interactivity

Changes to checkboxes in the header or sidebar apply instantly and are reflected in all sections for consistency.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend

The backend handles business logic and interacts with the database to store, retrieve, and process insurance configurations.
Key Features:

    Configurations: Stores coverages, discounts, and other options in MongoDB
    Pricing Endpoint: Calculates insurance prices based on city, customer age, coverages, and discounts
    Price Adjustments:
        Applies age and city-based calculations for base prices
        Calculates coverage and discount prices based on conditions (e.g., AO+ pricing by age, VIP discount for powerful vehicles)

Pricing Rules

The backend applies rules to calculate the final price:

    Coverages:
        Bonus Protection - 12% of base price
        AO+ - Fixed price based on age
        Glass Protection - 80% of vehicle power
    Discounts/Surcharges:
        Various discounts and surcharges are applied based on selections and vehicle power
        Price matching feature adjusts the total price to match a specified value, recalculating the base price as needed

Technology Stack

    Frontend: React with TypeScript (strict type checking), Redux-toolkit state management, CSS
    Backend: Node.js with RESTful or GraphQL API, MongoDB

üß© Extra Points

    Unit Tests: Using a testing library of choice
    Data Logging: Save data to the database and present it on a separate route
    Developer-Friendly: Easy to set up and run in development mode; embedded database for local testing
